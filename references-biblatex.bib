  abstract = {On the desktop, an application can expect to control its user interface down to the last pixel, but on the World Wide Web, a content provider has no control over how the client will view the page, once delivered to the browser. This creates an opportunity for end-users who want to automate and customize their web experiences, but the growing complexity of web pages and standards prevents most users from realizing this opportunity. We describe Chickenfoot, a programming system embedded in the Firefox web browser, which enables end-users to automate, customize, and integrate web applications without examining their source code. One way Chickenfoot addresses this goal is a novel technique for identifying page components by keyword pattern matching. We motivate this technique by studying how users name web page components, and present a heuristic keyword matching algorithm that identifies the desired component from the user’s name.},

Gneiss closely integrates a spreadsheet editor with a web interface builder to let users demonstrate bindings between properties of web GUI elements and cells in the spreadsheet while working with real web service data. The spreadsheet editor provides two-way connections to web services, to both visualize and retrieve different data based on the user input in the web interface. Gneiss achieves rich interactivity without the need for event-based programming by extending the “pull model” of formulas that is familiar to the spreadsheet users.

  abstract = {Wrapper induction is the problem of automatically inferring a query from annotated web pages of the same template. This query should not only select the annotated content accurately but also other content following the same template. Beyond accurately matching the template, we consider two additional requirements: (1) wrappers should be robust against a large class of changes to the web pages, and (2) the induction process should be noise resistant, i.e., tolerate slightly erroneous (e.g., machine generated) samples. Key to our approach is a query language that is powerful enough to permit accurate selection, but limited enough to force noisy samples to be generalized into wrappers that select the likely intended items. We introduce such a language as subset of XPATH and show that even for such a restricted language, inducing optimal queries according to a suitable scoring is infeasible. Nevertheless, our wrapper induction framework infers highly robust and noise resistant queries. We evaluate the queries on snapshots from web pages that change over time as provided by the Internet Archive, and show that the induced queries are as robust as the human-made queries. The queries often survive hundreds sometimes thousands of days, with many changes to the relative position of the selected nodes (including changes on template level). This is due to the few and discriminative anchor (intermediately selected) nodes of the generated queries. The queries are highly resistant against positive noise (up to 50\%) and negative noise (up to 20\%).},

  abstract = {Millions of computer end users need to perform tasks over tabular spreadsheet data, yet lack the programming knowledge to do such tasks automatically. This paper describes the design and implementation of a robust natural language based interface to spreadsheet programming. Our methodology involves designing a typed domain-specific language (DSL) that supports an expressive algebra of map, filter, reduce, join, and formatting capabilities at a level of abstraction appropriate for non-expert users. The key algorithmic component of our methodology is a translation algorithm for converting a natural language specification in the context of a given spreadsheet to a ranked set of likely programs in the DSL. The translation algorithm leverages the spreadsheet spatial and temporal context to assign interpretations to specifications with implicit references, and is thus robust to a variety of ways in which end users can express the same task. The translation algorithm builds over ideas from keyword programming and semantic parsing to achieve both high precision and high recall. We implemented the system as an Excel add-in called NLyze that supports a rich user interaction model including annotating the user’s natural language specification and explaining the synthesized DSL programs by paraphrasing them into structured English. We collected a total of 3570 English descriptions for 40 spreadsheet tasks and our system was able to generate the intended interpretation as the top candidate for 94\% (97\% for the top 3) of those instances.},

By overlaying matches to these patterns on standard documents inside the Haystack semantic web browser, we enable a rich semantic interaction with existing web pages, “unwrapping” semantic data buried in the pages’ HTML.

These added features work inside the site’s own pages, preserving the site’s presentational style and the user’s context. Sifter contains an algorithm that scrapes structured data out of well-structured web pages while usually requiring no user intervention. We tested Sifter on real web sites and real users and found that people could use Sifter to perform sophisticated queries and high-level analyses on sizable data collections on the Web. We propose that web sites can be similarly augmented with other sophisticated data-centric functionality, giving users new benefits over the existing Web.},

Such “data wrangling” regularly involves reformatting data values or layout, correcting erroneous or missing values, and integrating multiple data sources. These transforms are often difficult to specify and difficult to reuse across analysis tasks, teams, and tools. In response, we introduce Wrangler, an interactive system for creating data transformations. Wrangler combines direct manipulation of visualized data with automatic inference of relevant transforms, enabling analysts to iteratively explore the space of applicable operations and preview their effects. Wrangler leverages semantic data types (e.g., geographic locations, dates, classification codes) to aid validation and type conversion. Interactive histories support review, refinement, and annotation of transformation scripts. User study results show that Wrangler significantly reduces specification time and promotes the use of robust, auditable transforms instead of manual editing.},

  abstract = {The Internet presents numerous sources of useful information—telephone directories, product catalogs, stock quotes, event listings, etc. Recently, many systems have been built that automatically gather and manipulate such information on a user's behalf. However, these resources are usually formatted for use by people (e.g., the relevant content is embedded in HTML pages), so extracting their content is difficult. Most systems use customized wrapper procedures to perform this extraction task. Unfortunately, writing wrappers is tedious and error-prone. As an alternative, we advocate wrapper induction, a technique for automatically constructing wrappers. In this article, we describe six wrapper classes, and use a combination of empirical and analytical techniques to evaluate the computational tradeoffs among them. We first consider expressiveness: how well the classes can handle actual Internet resources, and the extent to which wrappers in one class can mimic those in another. We then turn to efficiency: we measure the number of examples and time required to learn wrappers in each class, and we compare these results to PAC models of our task and asymptotic complexity analyses of our algorithms. Summarizing our results, we find that most of our wrapper classes are reasonably useful (70\% of surveyed sites can be handled in total), yet can rapidly learned (learning usually requires just a handful of examples and a fraction of a CPU second per example).},

  abstract = {Mashups are an increasingly popular way to integrate data from multiple web sites to fit a particular need, but it often requires substantial technical expertise to create them. To lower the barrier for creating mashups, we have extended the CoScripter web automation tool with a spreadsheet-like environment called Vegemite. Our system uses direct-manipulation and programming-by-demonstration tech-niques to automatically populate tables with information collected from various web sites. A particular strength of our approach is its ability to augment a data set with new values computed by a web site, such as determining the driving distance from a particular location to each of the addresses in a data set. An informal user study suggests that Vegemite may enable a wider class of users to address their information needs.},

This chapter discusses several prototypes that implement sloppy programming, translating sloppy commands directly into executable code. It also describes the algorithms used in these prototypes, exposes their limitations, and proposes directions for future work. The techniques described in this discussion still just scratch the surface of a domain with great potential: translating sloppy commands into executable code. It has described potential benefits to end users and expert programmers alike, as well as advocated a continued need for textual command interfaces. A number of prototypes are discussed exploring this technology and what one can learn from them, including the fact that users can form commands for some of these systems without any training. Finally, it gave some high-level technical details about how to go about actually implementing sloppy translation algorithms, with some references for future reading.},

We believe that a useful technique is to have end users tailor their systems to match their personal work practices. This requires not only systems which can be tailored, but a culture within which users feel in control of the system and in which tailoring is the norm. In a two-pronged research project we have worked closely with a group of users to develop a system to support tailoring and to help the users evolve a “tailoring culture”. This has resulted in a flexible system based around the use of distributed on-screen Buttons to support a range of tailoring techniques.},

  abstract = {Programming by Examples (PBE) has the potential to revo­ lutionize end-user programming by enabling end users, most of whom are non-programmers, to create small scripts for au­ tomating repetitive tasks. However, examples, though often easy to provide, are an ambiguous specification of the user’s intent. Because of that, a key impedance in adoption of PBE systems is the lack of user confidence in the correctness of the program that was synthesized by the system. We present two novel user interaction models that communicate action­ able information to the user to help resolve ambiguity in the examples. One of these models allows the user to effectively navigate between the huge set of programs that are consis­ tent with the examples provided by the user. The other model uses active learning to ask directed example-based questions to the user on the test input data over which the user intends to run the synthesized program. Our user studies show that each of these models significantly reduces the number of errors in the performed task without any difference in completion time. Moreover, both models are perceived as useful, and the proactive active-learning based model has a slightly higher preference regarding the users’ confidence in the result.},

Liveness is one form of a more general class of behaviors by a programming environment that provide information to programmers about what they are constructing. This paper gives a brief historical perspective on liveness and proposes an extension of a hierarchy given in 1990, to now account for even more powerful executionoriented tools for programmers. In addition, while liveness concerns the timeliness of execution feedback, considering a broader array of forms of feedback is helpful both in better understanding liveness and in designing ever more powerful development tools.},
